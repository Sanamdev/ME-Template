#remove custom-editor-style
#recombine theme.scss to generate new css file - all custom-editor-style related files will be removed

* I will keep all gulp settings. Their gulp setting is fine, but because we don't use sass, that's gulp is useless for css now. With js and image compressing on gulp, we can use other tools archiving it. I will run gulp when have time to generate the new theme.css. We'll create our own ME folder putting all our own extra css, js, images here. 

#create ME folder with css, images, js and functions subfolders. 
All ME customised code will be there. We'll put a global function php code, such as add class to body, ME js and css enscript and other shortcode using in all sites, into global-functions.php; site unique functions, such as shortcode, site unique woocommerce code to site-unique-functions.php. A unique option folder is created to save options php code, css and js.

#update functions.php
#update style under wp-content/themes/Marketing eye, making it to ME.
**We'll change the author to ME if later we are going t change the original theme template. And screenshot of theme will be updated.
